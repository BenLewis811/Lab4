  Program: CSC115/170 Lab 04 - Feathers of Fortitude
 ----------------------------
  Partner 1:  
  Partner 1s contributions:

  Partner 2: Ben Lewis
  Partner 2s contributions: 
  3 and 5, opening narrative
  Date: 
      
      
  Tips:
    1. Read the entire Lab PDF so you understand what you need to do
    2. Describe each partners contributions - not just "Nate did part 1"
    3. Use proper coding standards
        * All import statements at the top of the code
        * Comment your code well - explain **WHY** you are doing it
        * Space out your code to make it more readable. Use blank lines and spaces around operators
        * No lines should go past **100** characters wide
        * All functions have **Docstrings** describing functionality, parameters, returns and an example
    4. Try not to repeat code.  Use functions and loops
    5. Do not use structures we have not covered in class yet.
    6. Double check all outputs have units and are rounded correctly.
    7. Rerun the code and test the output before submitting
    8. Work on the lab a little each day. Come to the help session if you need assistance
