  Tips:
    1. Read the entire Lab PDF so you understand what you need to do
    2. Describe each partners contributions - not just "Nate did part 1"
    3. Use proper coding standards
        * All import statements at the top of the code
        * Comment your code well - explain **WHY** you are doing it
        * Space out your code to make it more readable. Use blank lines and spaces around operators
        * No lines should go past **100** characters wide
* All functions have **Docstrings** describing functionality, parameters, returns and an example
    4. Try not to repeat code.  Use functions and loops
    5. Do not use structures we have not covered in class yet.
    6. Double check all outputs have units and are rounded correctly.
    7. Rerun the code and test the output before submitting
    8. Work on the lab a little each day. Come to the help session if you need assistance

The {duck_color} duck lands gracefully on the grass next to you and excitedly
begins to speak. "My name is {duckyName}", it quacks. "And I have been
sent by Ordin to assist you on your quest. Together we will defeat the evil
sorcerer and recover the Syn-tak - the mystical code that will heal the
king."

{duckyName} gets closer to you and whispers, "But first I will need to
teach you some new skills. Follow me!"

The duck walks over the crest of the hill, its {duck_color} feathers swaying as it
waddles. Obediently, you grab your effects and follow it, ready to train.
